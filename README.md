## Overview

This project tracks and compares carbon emissions estimates from two different models: `codecarbon` and `psutil`. The tracker records and plots emission rates to visualize and compare the performance of each model in estimating carbon emissions from energy consumption.

## Features

- **Carbon Emission Tracking:** Uses `codecarbon` and `psutil` to estimate and monitor carbon emissions.
- **Comparison Visualization:** Generates plots to compare emission estimates from both models.
- **Data Analysis:** Provides insights into the accuracy and reliability of different emission estimation methods.


## Requirements

- codecarbon
- psutil
- matplotlib
- pandas

## Usage

- Run the files named train.py for psutil and track_emission_codecarbon.py for codecarbon 
- Run the files(for bargraph) named plot.py for psutil and plot_emission_data.py for codecarbon
